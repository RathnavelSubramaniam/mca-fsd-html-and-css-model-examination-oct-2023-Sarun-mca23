        <h2>H I S T O R Y:</h2>
        <p>Brendan Eich first developed JavaScript, a computer language, in about ten days in May 1995. The language, formerly known as Mocha, later modified to LiveScript, and is now known simply as JavaScript, was created to be used on the client-side of websites, enabling the addition of dynamic and interactive components to static HTML texts.</p>
        <p> JavaScript was initially implemented in Netscape Navigator, which was the most popular browser at the time. The language was quickly adopted by Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer. Due to its simplicity of usage and the fact that it was the only client-side scripting language available at the time, JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers.</p>
        <p> JavaScript gained popularity during the ensuing years and was used to develop a wide range of web applications, such as online games, dynamic menus, and form validation. ECMAScript 4, a new version of the language, was planned in 2002, however, it was ultimately abandoned because of conflicts among the various browser vendors..</p>
        <p>With an estimated 95% of websites utilizing it in some capacity, JavaScript is currently one of the most popular programming languages in use worldwide. It is employed not only in web development but also in the creation of server-side applications, desktop and mobile applications, and even the programming of robots and other hardware.</p>
